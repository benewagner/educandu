    This is a simple paragraph. As you can see, no matter how many                  spaces or
    line
    breaks
    you enter, they will always be converted into one single space.

    To add forced line breaks, \
    end lines with multiple spaces<space><space>
    or with a backslash \
    just like here.

    To start a new paragraph, just leave one empty line on top of the text.

    Wrap text between asterisks *to make it italic* or double asterisks **to make it bold**. Alternatively you can also use _single_ or __double__ underscores. _You **can** also combine them_.

    # This is a first level header

    ## This is a second level header

    ### This is a third level header

    There are up to six levels, though it is recommended to not use such a deep hierarchy on websites.

    1. This is an ordered list
    2. You can also produce
        1. multiple levels
        2. by indenting each level by 4 spaces on the left
    42. As you can see, the numbering doesn't really matter, the list will always start with the number of the first item and then count up.

    * This is an unordered list
    * You can also use hyphens instead of asterisks
        * Also here, lists can be nested
        * Just indent each level by 4 spaces on the left

    As you have seen, some characters like **_** or **#** have special meaning in certain positions. In order to use them as a normal character, you have to prepend a backslash. For example:

    * This is interpreted as a list because of the asterisk in the beginning.

    \* This is just a normal paragraph beginning with an actual asterisk in the text.
